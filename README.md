# My vimfiles

    basically just my vimrc

1.Installation:
    
I guess just copy and paste or clone it and put it into your .vimrc.

FYI: I have a couple of plugins that rely on external downloads.

a)ALE: requires that you install the linter that you want to use. ALE has a lot of compatibility with linters it just requires that they are installed.
you can check the compatible linters here: https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale/blob/master/supported-tools.md

b)NERDTREE-DevIcons: this requires that you have a properly installed font that will allow for icons to be shown. I personally used the DejaVuSansMono Nerdfont.
you can find fonts here: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/tag/v2.2.2
can also install in a different way here: https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-installation

I think that sums it up for the most part.

2.Usage:
    
its a vimrc bb, do what you want with it.

3.Credits:

Most of this was done by me, however there are various plugins that ive used. Most should have credits in them via link or repo name.
